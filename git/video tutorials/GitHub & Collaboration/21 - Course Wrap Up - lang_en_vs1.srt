1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,784
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:03,655
You've reached the end of another course.

3
00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:06,000
You are a version control pro.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,235
But remember that you get better at something the more you do it.

5
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:11,310
So why don't you practice your new skills on

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,260
an open source project by adding to

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,230
the documentation or by supplying a code example or two.

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,860
You could even translate the material into your native language.

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,870
Check the links below for some info on how to get

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,545
involved and start collaborating with others.

11
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:29,350
So maybe you found this all easy or maybe you found the material somewhat challenging.

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,950
But the important thing is that knowing these skills and

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,180
techniques is the first major step in how to collaborate effectively.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,150
The web is built through collaboration by people all over

15
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,810
the world and now you have those skills to join those ranks.

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,460
So keep going. I can't wait to see what you build.
