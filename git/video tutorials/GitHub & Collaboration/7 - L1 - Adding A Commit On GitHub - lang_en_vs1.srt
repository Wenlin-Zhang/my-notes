00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,645
Okay, let's take just a second to orient ourselves to the page.

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:06,465
I'm here on my personal GitHub account

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:10,050
and we're looking at the my-travel-plans repository.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,025
Now this is the remote repository.

5
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:13,840
This is the my-travel-plans repo,

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,560
but up on GitHub so it's the remote one.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,115
And this remote repository has three commits.

8
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:24,330
So we need to manually create some commits using the GitHub interface.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,570
So we can create a new file with this create new file button.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,530
That will take us to this page where we can name the file and then set up

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,380
some of the configurations and then here we can add our content.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,270
So we could say this would be like app.js and I like

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,105
four spaces and then we can add some content here.

14
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:46,050
But we're not going to do this right now.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,410
We're actually going to edit an existing file.

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,120
So let's go into the css folder and edit the app.css file.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,670
Now, here we need to click on this kind of tucked away pencil icon to edit the file.

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,050
Now, here's our file,

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,680
and let's just scroll down and I want to get to the place where I want to edit.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,800
Now when we hover over the destination,

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,865
let's change the heading so it rotates back to a normal position.

22
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:17,170
Now we want this rotation to happen smoothly so let's add a transition.

23
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,745
Now that we've added these changes we can actually scroll back to the top,

24
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:25,730
click on preview changes and then see the changes that we're about to commit.

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,439
These changes look great to me,

26
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,050
so let's scroll down and actually make this commit.

27
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,460
I think add animation to destination headings is a good commit message.

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,535
So, that works for me and I'll just commit these changes.

29
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:41,045
So we have this commit that we just made right now.

30
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:44,255
Let's go back and check out the main page.

31
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:47,645
Notice that we now have four commits when we previously had three,

32
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:51,380
and that the css folder there has been a change 11 seconds ago.

33
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:57,000
If we go inside that folder we'll see that app.css was changed 29 seconds ago.
