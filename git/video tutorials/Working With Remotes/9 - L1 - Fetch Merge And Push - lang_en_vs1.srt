1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
This is the familiar starting point that we're used to,

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,200
where our local repository is behind the remote repository.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,450
Now, let's pretend we didn't realize we were behind

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,860
the remote repository and made a commit in our local repo.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,630
So now we have two repositories that have

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,240
the first same few commits but their master branches are pointing at different things.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,805
If we tried running git pull right now, it wouldn't work.

8
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:27,420
But we know that we can use git fetch

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,460
to just retrieve the remote commits without merging.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,930
So if we run git fetch origin master,

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,580
that will bring down the commits on

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,780
the remote repository and it'll make origin/master point to them.

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,195
Since we're on our master branch,

14
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:45,480
we can just run git merge origin/master

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,615
to bring the remote changes into our master branch.

16
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:53,549
Now our local repository has commits but the remote one doesn't have,

17
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:55,120
so we need to push them.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,000
A quick git push origin master will update the remote repository with our local commits.
