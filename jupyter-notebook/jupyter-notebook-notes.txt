Magic keywords

1. start with % or %%

Matplotlib:
2. set up matplotlib to work interactively in the notebook with %matplotlib
3. To render figures directly in the notebook, you should use the inline backend with the command %matplotlib inline
4. On higher resolution screens such as Retina displays, the default images in notebooks can look blurry. Use %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' after %matplotlib inline to render higher resolution images.

Timing:
5. You can use the %timeit magic command to time how long it takes for a function to run
6. If you want to time how long it takes for a whole cell to run, youâ€™d use %%timeit

Debugging:
7. With the Python kernel, you can turn on the interactive debugger using the magic command %pdb. When you cause an error, you'll be able to inspect the variables in the current namespace.
