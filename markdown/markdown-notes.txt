Mark down:

1. Headers

You can write headers using the pound/hash/octothorpe symbol # placed before the text. One # renders as an h1 header, two #s is an h2, and so on. Looks like this:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

2. Links

Linking in Markdown is done by enclosing text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses, like this [Udacity's home page](https://www.udacity.com) for a link to Udacity's home page.

3. Emphasis

You can add emphasis through bold or italics with asterisks or underscores (* or _). For italics, wrap the text in one asterisk or underscore, _gelato_ or *gelato* renders as gelato.

Bold text uses two symbols, **aardvark** or __aardvark__ looks like aardvark.

Either asterisks or underscores are fine as long as you use the same symbol on both sides of the text.

4. Code

There are two different ways to display code, inline with text and as a code block separated from the text. To format inline code, wrap the text in backticks. For example, `string.punctuation` renders as string.punctuation.

To create a code block, start a new line and wrap the text in three backticks

```
import requests
response = requests.get('https://www.udacity.com')
```

or indent each line of the code block with four spaces.

import requests
response = requests.get('https://www.udacity.com')

5. Math expressions

You can create math expressions in Markdown cells using LaTeX symbols. Notebooks use MathJax to render the LaTeX symbols as math symbols. To start math mode, wrap the LaTeX in dollar signs $y = mx + b$ for inline math. For a math block, use double dollar signs,

$$
y = \frac{a}{b+c}
$$

This is a really useful feature, so if you don't have experience with LaTeX please read this primer on using it to create math expressions.
